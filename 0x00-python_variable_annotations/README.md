# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

For this project we looked at Python - Variable Annotations and the purpose:
* Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
* Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.

## Learning Objectives.

* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy
